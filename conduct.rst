Nengo Code of Conduct

Why have a code of conduct?
===========================

This Code of Conduct is designed to
help all of us build a pleasant,
productive, and fearless community.
The purpose of the Code of Conduct
is not to burden the team with a bunch of needless rules,
or to give us a punishment mechanism for people "being bad,"
or even to correct things that have been wrong in the past.
We are striving to make our team
a great group of people to work with,
especially for those people who have faced
more adverse working environments in the past.

Social rules
============

No feigning surprise
--------------------

Don't act surprised when people say
they don't know something,
or ask a question that has
what you feel is an "obvious" answer.
This applies to both technical things
("I can't believe you don't know what the stack is!")
and non-technical things ("You don't know who RMS is?!").
Feigning surprise or pointing out
the "obviousness" of something
has no social or educational benefit;
these reactions are usually an attempt
to make the writer feel better about themselves
and the reader feel worse.
Even when that's not the intention,
it's almost always the effect.
This rule is tightly coupled
to our belief in the importance of people
feeling comfortable saying
"I don't know" and "I don't understand."

No backseat driving
-------------------

If a thread is working through a problem,
you shouldn't join the thread,
drop an advice bomb, then leave.
This can lead to the "too many cooks" problem,
but more importantly,
it can be rude and disruptive
to half-participate in a conversation.
This isn't to say you shouldn't help,
offer advice, or join conversations---on the contrary,
we encourage all those things.
Rather, it means that when you want to
help out or work with others,
you should fully engage
and not just interject sporadically.
If you want to show support
for an idea presented in a thread,
consider using a simple thumbs up emoji reaction
rather than stating the same point a different way.
If you feel that there is a different approach
that could be taken,
but you do not have the time or motivation
to implement that approach yourself,
make a note to yourself to explore that approach
when you have time
instead of putting that burden on someone else.

Time
====

Be respectful of other people:
their time, their location,
and other considerations of a distributed team.

Be on time to meetings.
Read the meeting agenda ahead of time,
and if something requires your input
and you cannot make the meeting,
tell the meeting organizer.

Resist the temptation
to have local-only meetings
when remote teammates should be involved.
Take the discussion to the forum,
a group hangout, Github issue,
or dev meeting as appropriate.

Keep in mind that what you write once
will be read by several people.
Writing a short message means people
can understand the conversation as efficiently as possible.
When a long explanation is necessary,
consider adding a summary.
Try to bring new arguments to a conversation
so that each message adds something unique to the thread,
keeping in mind that the rest of the thread
sill contains the other messages that have already been made.

Try to stay on topic,
especially in discussions that are already fairly large.
If a discussion brings to mind some related
but separate issue,
please start a separate discussion for it.
Everyone that is participating in an existing discussion
will naturally wish to respond to your comment.
If it is a separate discussion,
each person can choose to join that discussion
or spend their time some other way.

Giving feedback
===============

Give constructive, not critical feedback.
Feedback is negatively critical
when it focuses on something wrong
with someone or something they produced,
especially without any mention
of ways to make their behavior or their product better.
Critical feedback on work often looks like
"you don't write enough tests"
or "your code quality isn't good enough."
Personal criticism can be more severe
and often looks like "you should be less judgmental"
or "you are a burden because you ask too many questions."

Constructive feedback
is more about how a person can do better
rather than what they are doing wrong.
If you want someone to do something better,
you should tell them what better looks like.
Ask a question to get a discussion rolling,
to gain context,
and then if you see room for improvement
give declarative feedback to that effect.
This creates an environment
where people understand what success looks like
instead of just feeling like they are unsuccessful.

Just as you shouldn't interact with people poorly in person,
do not interact poorly through code or code review.
Assume that the other person is smart and capable,
even if they don't have the same expertise as you.
Go about your review under the assumption
that the decisions were made for a reason,
not in a vacuum.
Ask about circumstances if you're confused or uncertain.
Be pragmatic, ask for context, don't filibuster,
don't block on style not explicitly covered in our style guides.
Fight for your way if you think it's right, but not only to be right.

Receiving feedback
==================

While the reviewer must do their best
to be constructive in their feedback,
so must the reader do their best
to read a comment as attempting to be constructive
and not personally critical---as hard as this may be
when you are passionate about what you do.
Assume that the reviewer is trying to help
and is not trying to make you feel bad.

You are not your products.
It is important to realize that it's better
to find errors in review than in production
and recognize that your work fits into a larger whole.

A review is not a test
that you must pass to be accepted by the community.
By creating something to be reviewed,
you are already a member of our community.

Enactment
=========

If somebody requests that you stop a certain behavior
(even if said behavior is not explicitly covered in this document),
you are expected to comply immediately.
Complying is not an admission of guilt or of a transgression;
rather, it is an acknowledgment that
further discussion of what caused the request
is probably a good idea.
Work with the other party to fix the situation.
If the miscommunication happened in writing,
move the discussion to a richer medium like a video chat.
Use the opportunity to
build stronger relationships and better the team.

Enforcement of the Code of Conduct is essential.
If there is no enforcement,
then the Code of Conduct becomes a feel-good document without value.
Individuals should feel empowered to call out violations publicly or privately.
:ref:`Maintainers of Nengo projects <Nengo ecosystem>`
are available to help moderate, address concerns, and solve violations.
