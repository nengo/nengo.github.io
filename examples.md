## Tutorials accessible in Nengo GUI

The basics of how to build models and visualize them with Nengo GUI
are described in tutorials built into the Nengo GUI.
Access them through the *built-in examples* folder
in the file view at the top-left.

- `basics` shows the basic features of Nengo GUI in no particular order.
  Start here if you want a brief overview.
- `hbb_tutorials` is a set of tutorials from the book
  [How to Build a Brain](https://www.amazon.com/How-Build-Brain-Architecture-Architectures/dp/0190262125/),
  updated to work with current versions of Nengo.
- `recurrent` shows some dynamic neural networks like attractor networks
  that are straightforward to implement in Nengo.
- `tutorial` is a set of 25 guided examples going from a network of one neuron
  to networks of hundreds of thousands of neurons implementing cognitive models.
