## Tutorials accessible in NengoGUI

The basics of how to build models and visualize them with NengoGUI
are described in tutorials built into the NengoGUI.
Access them through the *built-in examples* folder
in the file view at the top-left.

- `basics` shows the basic features of NengoGUI in no particular order.
  Start here if you want a brief overview.
- `hbb_tutorials` is a set of tutorials from the book
  [How to Build a Brain](https://www.amazon.com/How-Build-Brain-Architecture-Architectures/dp/0190262125/),
  updated to work with current versions of Nengo.
- `recurrent` shows some dynamic neural networks like attractor networks
  that are straightforward to implement in Nengo.
- `tutorial` is a set of 25 guided examples going from a network of one neuron
  to networks of hundreds of thousands of neurons implementing cognitive models.
