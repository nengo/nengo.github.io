#### Personal data we collect

ABR collects data from you, through our interactions with you and
through our products. You provide some of this data directly, and we
get some of it by collecting data about your interactions, use and
experiences with our products. The data we collect depends on the
context of your interactions with ABR and the choices that you make,
including your privacy settings and the products and features that you
use. We also obtain data about you from third parties.

<a name="your-choice" class="anchor">

#### Your choice to provide data

You have choices when it comes to the technology you use and the data
you share. When we ask you to provide personal data, you can
decline. Some of our products require some personal data to provide
you with a service. If you choose not to provide data necessary to
provide you with a product or feature, you cannot use that product or
feature. Likewise, where we need to collect personal data by law or to
enter into or carry out a contract with you, and you do not provide
the data, we will not be able to enter into the contract; or if this
relates to an existing product you’re using, we may have to suspend or
cancel it. We will notify you if this is the case at the time. Where
providing the data is optional, and you choose not to share personal
data, some or all features of the relevant products, that use such
data, will not work for you.

rights, to your organisation’s administrators. ABR is not responsible
for the privacy or security practices of our customers, which may
differ from those set forth in this privacy statement.

products and that product or email address was provided by an
organisation you are affiliated with, such as an employer or school,
that organisation can and may:

    account, including controlling privacy-related settings of the
    product or product account.

    diagnostic data and the contents of your communications and files
    associated with your ABR product and product accounts.

to products and the content associated with those products, including
those you acquired on your own behalf, if you used your work or
educational institution account to sign in to such products.
