There is independent documentation
for each of the projects
in the :ref:`Nengo ecosystem`.
Clicking the |docbutton| button for the project
will take you to the appropriate site.

This page provides a quick guide to running Nengo models.

Running models
==============

There are two ways to run Nengo models.
They can be run either with the Nengo GUI,
or they can be run with a Python interpreter.

With Nengo GUI
--------------

The `Nengo GUI <https://github.com/nengo/nengo-gui>`_
is a web-based interface
for designing and running Nengo models.
To start the GUI,
open a terminal and run the ``nengo`` command.

To access the GUI,
you use a web browser
like Google Chrome or Firefox.
You should see a depiction
of the network on the left panel,
and a code editor on the right panel.

The network illustration
on the left panel is interactive.
You can drag to move the network objects,
scroll with the mouse to zoom in and out,
and right-click on objects to
display plots that will update in real time
as the model simulates (see the
`GUI documentation <https://github.com/nengo/nengo-gui#basic-usage>`_
for more details).

The code editor on the right panel
shows the Python code defining the Nengo model.
While you can write any Python code
in this editor,
we add a few additional constraints
to ensure the GUI runs smoothly:

* Your top-level network must be called ``model``.

* You cannot construct a ``Simulator`` object,
  as the GUI makes its own ``Simulator`` under the hood.

* You cannot show plots created with Matplotlib,
  as the GUI has its own set of visualizations.

To access a series of tutorials
that introduce you to the GUI
and to the basics of building models with Nengo,
click on the folder icon at the top-left of the GUI,
select "built-in examples", and then "tutorial".

If you see a warning that says something like
``Warning: Simulators cannot be manually run
inside nengo_gui``,
then you are likely running a model
that is designed to run with a Python interpreter
(see below for details).
If the model you are trying to run
is a Nengo example,
then it's likely that a similar example
exists within the built-in examples
accessible through the folder icon
at the top-left of the GUI.

With a Python interpreter
-------------------------

The `Nengo core <https://www.nengo.ai/nengo/>`_ is written in
`Python <https://www.python.org/>`_.
In order to install Nengo,
you likely also installed
a Python distribution,
whether it be through a package manager
provided by your operating system,
through `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_,
or by some other means.
You can use Nengo through any Python interpreter,
like any other Python package.

All Python distributions come with
an interpreter that you can usually run
through a terminal by typing in ``python``
and hitting enter.
You should see a prompt that looks like this:

.. code:: bash

   $ python
   Python 3.5.3 (default, Jan 19 2017, 14:11:04)
   [GCC 6.3.0 20170118] on linux
   Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   >>>

You can then import ``nengo`` and start building models.

>>> import nengo
>>> model = nengo.Network("My model")

The `examples included with Nengo core <coreexamples_>`_
can be downloaded as Python scripts
(text files that have the ``.py`` extension).
These scripts can be run from a terminal.
For example, after downloading
`single_neuron.py
<https://www.nengo.ai/nengo/examples/single_neuron.html>`_,
you can run it like this:

.. code:: bash

   $ python single_neuron.py

If all goes well, you will see a plot
generated by `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_.
Since Nengo is a normal Python package,
it interacts well with other
`Scientific Python packages <https://www.scipy.org/>`_.

The `Jupyter notebook <http://jupyter.org/>`_
provides another way to run Python scripts.
We also provide Nengo core examples
as Jupyter notebooks because you can see
plots in the same interface as the code.
Jupyter notebooks are also text files,
but have the extension ``.ipynb``.
These are run through the Jupyter notebook.
For example, after downloading
`single_neuron.ipynb
<https://www.nengo.ai/nengo/examples/single_neuron.ipynb>`_,
you can start the notebook like this:

.. code:: bash

   $ jupyter notebook

and then click on ``single_neuron.ipynb`` to run the example.

To access a series of tutorials
that use Nengo with a Python interpreter,
`see the Nengo documentation <coreexamples_>`_.
