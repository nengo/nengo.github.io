**Nengo with Neuromorphic Hardware:**

The Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience at the University of
Waterloo is excited to announce our 9th annual Nengo summer school
on large-scale brain modelling and neuromorphic computing. As a
recurring special feature of the school, participants will be given
on-site access to neuromorphic hardware, including Stanford’s mixed digital/analog chip
[Braindrop](https://web.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/),
the [SpiNNaker](http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/SpiNNaker/) chip, and a
variety of [FPGAs](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-fpga/).

In addition to teaching participants to run applications on neuromorphic
hardware using the Nengo simulation package, this two-week school will
teach participants to use Nengo to build state-of-the-art
cognitive and neural models. More generally, Nengo provides users
with a versatile and powerful environment for designing cognitive
and neural systems, and has been used to build what is currently
the world’s largest functional brain model, Spaun, which includes
spiking deep learning, reinforcement learning, adaptive motor
control, and cognitive control networks.

We welcome applications from all interested graduate students,
postdocs, professors, and industry professionals. No specific
training in the use of modelling software is required, but we
encourage applications from active researchers with a relevant
background in psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science,
computer science, robotics, neuromorphic engineering, or a related
field. More information about Nengo, the Neural Engineering
Framework, and Spaun can be found at
<https://www.nengo.ai/>.
Many of the concepts to be covered are in
[this book](http://www.amazon.com/How-Build-Brain-Architecture-Architectures/dp/0199794545).

the summer school!

**Purpose:** The main goal of the summer school is to
have participants learn to build state-of-the-art neural or
cognitive models using Nengo. Participants are encouraged to bring
their own ideas for projects, which may focus on testing
hypotheses, modelling neural or cognitive data, implementing
specific behavioural functions with neurons, expanding past
models, or provide a proof-of-concept of various neural
mechanisms. Projects can be focused on software, hardware, or a
combination of both.

**Approach:** Discussions during the school will help
shape projects, develop new collaborations, and generate new ideas
for projects. Participants will have the opportunity to learn how
to:

- use Nengo to program neuromorphic hardware systems, including Loihi!
- integrate machine learning methods into biologically oriented models
- interface Nengo with cameras and robotic systems of various kinds
- build perceptual, motor, and cognitive models with spiking neurons
- simulate large-scale models at a variety of levels of detail concurrently
- model anatomical and electrophysiological data
- model cognitive and behavioural data with a detailed neural model
- use a variety of single cell models within a large-scale model
- use your favorite simulator, e.g. NEST, Brian, Neuron, etc.
- implement modern non-linear control methods in a neural model
- and much more ...

**Format:** The first few days of the summer school
will be be devoted to in-depth tutorials on using Nengo for neural
and cognitive modelling. The rest of summer school will be devoted
primarily to project work, with a variety of faculty guest
lectures and optional tutorials scheduled throughout. A project
demonstration and evening banquet will be held on the last day,
with a variety of prizes for strong projects! The complete
schedule and list of guest lecturers will be announced at a later
date.

**Dates:** June 2nd - June 14th, 2024

**Location:** University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada
([map](http://goo.gl/Sa074A))

**Cost:** A registration fee is required of all
participants (USD $550 for academic participants; USD $1000 for
industry participants).

This fee includes the cost of breakfast, lunch, and snacks during
each weekday of the school, along with a summer school T-shirt!
Some evening meals will also be covered. Participants are
responsible for covering the cost of their travel, accommodations,
and recreational activities.

**Travel:**
For most participants, arrival through Toronto’s Pearson
International Airport is the most convenient option. The
University of Waterloo is approximately a one hour drive away, and
a number of shuttle services are available to take you directly to
the University from the airport. A list of general travel options
can be found
[here](https://uwaterloo.ca/international-student-guide/resources/prepare/arranging-travel-waterloo)

**Accommodations:** On-campus accommodations will be
made available to all confirmed participants. The summer school rates
for these accommodations will be announced at a later date.

**Applications:**
To apply, you will need to submit a CV and a brief proposal for a
project. At the summer school you’ll be able to make use of neuromorphic
hardware, event-based vision sensors, simple humanoid and non-humanoid robotic
devices, and a variety of large-scale cognitive modelling techniques. If
applicable, please briefly indicate how you might leverage this infrastructure
in your project. The application form is available
[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2ywL6WhF21IMjVbF-l_LjZiYIXKob37n6jEkXn7Vvk6Kw_Q/viewform?usp=sf_link).

**Application deadline:** Applications are due on **February 1, 2024**, [anywhere on Earth](https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth).

**Contact information:** For any questions, please contact
