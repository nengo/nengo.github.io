**Nengo with Loihi:**

The Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience
at the University of Waterloo is excited
to announce our 6th annual Nengo summer school
on large-scale brain modelling and neuromorphic computing.
As a special feature of this year's school,
participants will be given on-site access to
`Loihi <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8259423>`_,
a neuromorphic research chip developed by Intel Labs.
Other neuromorphic devices likely to be available at the
summer school include Stanford’s mixed digital/analog 
chip `Braindrop <https://web.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/>`_,
and `SpiNNaker <http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/SpiNNaker/>`_.

In addition to teaching participants to run applications
on Loihi using the Nengo simulation package,
this two-week school will teach participants to use
Nengo to build state-of-the-art cognitive and neural models.
More generally, Nengo provides users
with a versatile and powerful environment
for designing cognitive and neural systems,
and has been used to build what is currently
the world's largest functional brain model, Spaun,
which includes spiking deep learning, reinforcement learning,
adaptive motor control, and cognitive control networks.

We welcome applications from all interested
graduate students, postdocs,
professors, and industry professionals.
No specific training in the use of modelling software is required,
but we encourage applications from active researchers
with a relevant background in
psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science,
computer science, robotics, neuromorphic engineering,
or a related field.
More information about Nengo,
the Neural Engineering Framework, and Spaun
can be found at http://www.nengo.ai.
Many of the concepts to be covered are in `this book
<http://www.amazon.com/How-Build-Brain-Architecture-Architectures/dp/0199794545>`_.

**Purpose:**
The main goal of the summer school is to have participants
learn to build state-of-the-art neural or cognitive models using Nengo.
Participants are encouraged
to bring their own ideas for projects,
which may focus on testing hypotheses,
modelling neural or cognitive data,
implementing specific behavioural functions with neurons,
expanding past models,
or provide a proof-of-concept of various neural mechanisms.
Projects can be focused on software, hardware, or a combination of both.

**Approach:**
Discussions during the school
will help shape projects,
develop new collaborations,
and generate new ideas for projects.
Participants will have the opportunity to learn how to:

- use Nengo to program neuromorphic hardware systems, including Loihi!
- build models through detailed hands-on tutorials
- build perceptual, motor, and cognitive models with spiking neurons
- simulate large-scale models at a variety of levels of detail concurrently
- model anatomical and electrophysiological data
- model cognitive and behavioural data with a detailed neural model
- use a variety of single cell models within a large-scale model
- use your favorite simulator, e.g. NEST, Brian, Neuron, etc.
- integrate machine learning methods into biologically oriented models
- interface Nengo with cameras and robotic systems of various kinds
- implement modern non-linear control methods in a neural model
- and much more...

**Format:**
The first few days of the summer school
will be be devoted to in-depth tutorials
on using Nengo for neural and cognitive modelling.
The rest of summer school
will be devoted primarily to project work,
with a variety of faculty guest lectures
and optional tutorials scheduled throughout.
A project demonstration and evening banquet
will be held on the last day,
with a variety of prizes for strong projects!
The complete schedule and list of guest lecturers
will be announced at a later date.

**Dates:**
June 9th - June 21st, 2019

**Location:**
University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada (`map <http://goo.gl/Sa074A>`_)

**Cost:**
A registration fee is required of all participants
(C$600 for academic participants; C$1200 for industry participants).

This fee includes the cost of breakfast, lunch, and snacks
during each weekday of the school,
along with a summer school T-shirt!
Some evening meals will also be covered.
Participants are responsible for
covering the cost of their travel, accommodations, and recreational activities.

**Travel:**
For most participants,
arrival through Toronto's Pearson International Airport
is the most convenient option.
The University of Waterloo is approximately a one hour drive away,
and a number of shuttle services are available
to take you directly to the University from the airport.
A list of general travel options can be found
`here <https://uwaterloo.ca/about/how-find-us/maps-and-directions>`__.

**Accommodations:**
On-campus accommodations will be arranged for all confirmed participants.
The summer school rates
for these accommodations will be announced at a later date.

**Applications:**
To apply, you will need to submit a CV and a brief proposal for a project.
The application form is available
`here <https://goo.gl/forms/8h0wCYV6AKIFpIKF3>`__.

**Application deadline:**
Applications are due on **February 15th, 2019**.
